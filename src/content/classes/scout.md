#### Main Tasks

- Collecting minerals
- Lighting up caves to spot minerals and dangers from above (cave leeches, acid spitters, etc.)
- Killing [[High priority enemies]] - Scout has the least firepower, but can quickly take down dangerous enemies.

#### Tips

- Use the freeze grenade to quickly kill or temporarily neutralize enemies - Especially Mactera and Breeders die instantly from the freeze grenade and Spitballers and Menaces can be easily killed after frozen. You can zip to a Breeder, freeze in in mid air and avoid fall damage with one of the below tricks
- Try to ping the most important mineral patches, if they are not already platformed by the engineer
- You can mine minerals without platforms - You can either land on top of most minerals or with a little practice you can zip above the mineral patch, do a power axe hit and try to stay in the resulting hole to keep mining from there
- Use the grapple hook to avoid fall damage - You can grapple yourself to the floor to avoid fall damage
- Use overclocks to avoid dying from fall damage - There are two specific good ones for this task, 1. Hoverclock for the M1000 (use shortly before hitting the ground) 2. Special powder for the xyz (depending on your height, use 1 or 2 times targeted at the ground to avoid fall damage)
- If you want maximum mobility, use special powder OC - It can makes you go really fast, but can also kill you

#### Overclock recommendations

- Hoverclock or special powder to avoid fall damage, I prefer special powder for more utility and the more flexibility on the M1000
