#### Main tasks

- Kill enemies (yes, it’s one of the classes with the most firepower)
- Drill - Open up dirt, create tunnels to the pumpjacks on refinery; little shelters/caves to protect from waves/macteras; back to the pod, when finished with the mission; aquarqs out of the wall; etc.

#### Tips

- The EPC can be used for mining minerals from the wall - While this can help the scout and can especially help in escort duty to get oil shale off the wall, be careful to not hurt your scout
- You can use explosives for mining, but be even more careful - Especially helpful to mine gold from [crassus detonator](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Glyphid_Crassus_Detonator?so=search)
- Try to help the scout with the gold from a [crassus detonator](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Glyphid_Crassus_Detonator?so=search) by drilling around the gold layer and remove all connections to the wall to make it collapse
- When using your drills, don't let it overheat, only drill until 99% makes drilling a lot faster.
- You can burn spider webs with the flamethrower
- When using the [vampire perk](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire), it is triggered by the pickaxe, the throwing axes and the drills
- Although heavily discussed, the explosive's red shield is not better than the green shield - Be careful to not kill you fellow dwarfs too often with explosives
- Bunkers are often more dangerous than useful, especially on H5 and higher - If for example a detonator spawns, it’s a death trap. It also takes the fun out of some modes.
- Although bunkers are rarely used, know how to create one, if you are ever in need to bunker up in a critical situation.
- You can throw axes very quick and do things like killing an oppressor in one freeze by holding Q (previous weapon) and pressing G (throw grenade) and letting them both go afterwards.
- When using flamethrower with sticky flames, change your playstyle to focus more on indirect damage. Place down a line of fire and try to get as many bugs as possible to run through that.

#### Overclock recommendations

- Sticky flames for crowd control
