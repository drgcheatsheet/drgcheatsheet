#### Main tasks

- Killing enemies (obviously)
- Supporting a little with some zips lines

#### Tips

- The gunner is the most straight forward class, you aim and shoot
- The "born ready" overclock is very helpful on many Gunner weapons
- Try to fill in the gap if you are missing one class in your game, when you are not busy shooting bugs
- You can grab a zip line again in mid air when you are shot at or when you need to get an item like a boolo cap. Just press E (X on Xbox) fast enough.

#### Overclock recommendations

- For dreadnought build lead storm
- For maximum ammo efficiency neurotoxin
- For fun reflecting minigun bullets
