#### Main tasks

- Kill enemies
- Shoot platforms - Primarily for scout, also to block the way of the creeps or bridge holes or to make stairs

#### Tips

- You don't need to skill "Supercharged Feed Mechanism" for Platform Gun, as it can heavily benefit from animation cancelling
- Proactively shoot platforms to every mineral you see and don't wait for pings - This includes secondary objectives, beer plants and everything else collectable
- Don't forget to put down and recall your turret(s)
- Don't put down proximity mines on the ground where you need to defend, put them in the walking path of the bugs. Otherwise they make heavy friendly fire!
- Your turrets are refilled when recalled, this is sometimes faster or easier than refilling it directly, e.g. when migrating to another cave or when you are on the run
- You can shape the paths of creeps by putting down platforms on the ground, if you have skilled "Repellant Additive" at tier 3.
- When you are defending a specific point on the map, for example in salvage operation, you can use the platforms to create a roof to protect from mactera and further shape the creeps way.
- Always create roofs at least in a height that you can still jump.
- You can parkour on the wall using animation cancelling and shooting platforms in front of your
- Protect your fellow dwarfs or yourself from fall damage - If a teammate or you are falling down, put a platform on the ground below to avoid or reduce fall damage (Plastcrete MKII at tier 2)
- If your are using "Turret Arc" overclock, equip two turrets to create a turret arc between them
- If you need a lot of damage in a specific area, e.g. for a dreadnought fight, throw 2 or more proximity mines on the same place
- You can choose which turret to move by tapping R when in turret placement mode. thx @[Nova_Bomber](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nova_Bomber/)
- You can use the overclock "RJ250 Compound" to jump with heavy objects. The time window is quite small, but doable. thx @[Darkon-Kriv](https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkon-Kriv/)

#### Overclock recommendations

- Spinning death with stun to escape or trap single enemies as well as waves. Has saved my more often than I can count
- Hyper Propellant for a dreadnought/high single target damage build
- RJ250 Compound for a similar effect to Scout's special powder
