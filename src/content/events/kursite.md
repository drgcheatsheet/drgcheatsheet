<h3 id="kursite">Kursite Infection</h3>

<Accordion>

- You have to kill infected enemies, which can be identified by glowing yellow and having a big yellow chunk in their body
- When they are killed, the chunk (looks like a yellow aquarq) is dropped
- Try to get the dropped crystals into the kursite analyzer as fast as possible
- A good practice is to allocate one dwarf to the analyzer as a catcher and all other dwarfs to throw the crystals towards him
