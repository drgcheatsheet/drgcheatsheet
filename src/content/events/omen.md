<h3 id="omen">Omen Modular Exterminator</h3>

<Accordion>

- Tower with 3 random modules at each level that you need to eleminate each
- Use your laser pointer to figure out, which modules spawned at levels 2 and 3
- To destroy the different modules, you need to destroy all of its cooling tanks (green canisters). They come out, when you stay on one of the maintenance platforms and wait until the progress bar reached 100%
- Level 1 is always the Radial Pulse-Gun, try to eliminate it first, to make the whole thing easier
- <ClassHighlight name='scout'>Try to find one or more points high up above the Omen where the lasers cannot reach you and where you can see the drones soon enough. The M1000 ist really good at doing quick damage to the cooling tanks, the Scout is also really good as medic with the omen</ClassHighlight>
- <ClassHighlight name='gunner'>You have one of the most important jobs, activating the cooling tanks. Throw a shield on one of the platforms and stay on it until activated. You can also do a high amount of damage to the tanks. If there are Drones the Gunner should help destroying them before they reach any fellow dwarf</ClassHighlight>
- <ClassHighlight name='engineer'>You should prepare the Omenâ€™s maintenance platforms, by putting at least 3 of you own platforms on top of each one. INSERT PICTURE This way, you can still activate them, but without getting hit by the radial pulse-gun. You should also definitely put your turret(s) on a platform in 1-2 meters above the ground and refill it/them. They help a lot, especially against the drones. If you have some platforms left, put them as a roof above each maintenance platform to protect from drones, lasers, etc.. But like always, leave enough space to the top for you and your teammates to jump.</ClassHighlight>
- <ClassHighlight name='driller'>Your main task is in preparation. You can make tunnels for you and your teammates to hide in. The most common ones are tunnels behind all three maintenance platforms to connect all of them INSERT PICTURE or just straight down ca. 30 degree tunnel behind each maintenance platform. Also place your explosives at the bottom of Omen, to make damage as soon as the first module tanks are out. The rest of the time, try to help by killing drones or tanks with your secondary. Your primary will probably not help much, as the Omen has 70% resistance against explosions, fire and freeze damage. INSERT WIKI LINK</ClassHighlight>
