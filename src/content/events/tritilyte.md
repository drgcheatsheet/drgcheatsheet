- You have to get explosives from the nearby landed “Nanite Bomb Dispenser” and throw them at the Tritilyte Crystal
- The difficulty of this event is very dependent on where the “Nanite Bomb Dispenser” lands, so try to create the shortest and fastest way possible to it
- If you choose two dwarfs to carry the explosives and the other two to protect them from bugs, it will be a walk in the park. Under H4, you may even choose three dwarfs to carry the explosives
- Scout: You have low firepower and high mobility, so try to get to the bomb dispenser asap and carry explosives back and forth
- Gunner: Your main task during preparation is to shoot a zip line to the bomb dispenser, if possible, to create a direct connection. Your main task is protecting your teammates. Kill bugs and throw shields, so that they can survive while they are carrying the explosives
- Engineer: After eventually plugging holes or building bridges to better reach the bomb dispenser, place and refill your turret, if necessary protect the path from the dispenser to the tritilyte from flying enemies with a roof of platforms and start carrying explosives
- Driller: Your main task is to remove any obstacles in the way from the tritilyte deposit to the bomb dispenser. As soon as the bomb dispenser lands, dig a direct tunnel to it. If thats not possible, instruct the engineer to bridge a gap or the gunner to place a direct zip line. After that, help the gunner with crowd control to protect your teammates or start carrying explosives yourself if the gunner doesn’t need any help.
