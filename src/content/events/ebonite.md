- You have to kill mutated stone versions of Grunts and Praetorians
- They can only be killed by melee attacks
- Collect the blue canisters which are randomly spit out by the overcharge sprinkler, they basically eliminate your power attack cooldown
- The Drillers impact axes can help a lot as they also make melee damage
