<Accordion>

- Be a good host and buy beer for your fellow dwarfs
- Be friendly to new players and always try to help them and provide guidance instead of kicking them
- Subjective: Don’t use a server name like “At least level X”, “At least Y promotions”, etc.. We try to be a welcoming, friendly community and although it can be frustrating sometimes to have 3 unpromoted dwarfs in you lobby as a level 100+ player, we all started there. It can also be that a higher level player just started leveling another class, so promoted dwarfs restrictions make even less sense.
