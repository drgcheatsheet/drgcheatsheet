<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the unofficial [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/) guide!

This guide should help new dwarfs getting started and engaged cave crawlers to learn some new tactics to make even more profit for mission control. The focus is not on deep dive information (pun intended) on specific topics, but on tips and tricks that you only learn by playing that are part of the DRG`s culture.

First of all, the main goal of Deep Rock Galactic is to have fun killing bugs and mining minerals, always keep that in mind.

Some of the below strategies are most helpful in Hazard 4 (and higher) or if you are speed running, but getting used to them will help you in general.

If you have any feedback, feel free to create a PR or a discussion on GitHub.
