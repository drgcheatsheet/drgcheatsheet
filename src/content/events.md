So called “machine events” are 180 seconds challenges that spawn randomly after the host has promoted at least one character
- There can only be one machine event per level
- A spawn of a machine event doesn’t mean there can’t be another random spawn like Bet-C
- They are one of the main sources for overclocks and cosmetics
- You can take part in a machine event, even if you are not level 25 with your first character, but you will only gain experience, no overclocks
- Always start the events, as they give you XP even if you fail them
- After successfully finishing the event, you can choose between 3 random classes to exchange a “blank matrix core” to receive either a weapon overclock or a cosmetic. If the icon below the class has a hammer, it’s a weapon overclock, if it’s a hat, it’s a cosmetic.
