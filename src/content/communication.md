- Always rock and stone!
- More communication is always better, as long as you not spam
- Use the laser pointer to ping things like minerals, leeches and everything else importan, but don't spam, the scout has seen the minerals ;)
- Always ask before triggering events, mules, eggs, prospector, etc.
- Write a simple "r?" in the chat to ask if everyone is ready for the next stage, event, etc.
- If possible, warn your teammates of leeches, menaces, grabbers, spitballers
- If possible activate your microphone, it's highly appreciated
