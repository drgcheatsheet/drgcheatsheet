<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<Accordion>

- Always rock and stone!
- More communication is always better, as long as you not spam
- Use the laser pointer to ping things like minerals, leeches and everything else important, but don't spam, the scout has seen the minerals.
- Always ask before triggering events, mules, eggs, prospector, etc.
- Write a simple "r?" in the chat to ask if everyone is ready for the next stage, event, etc.
- If possible, warn your teammates of Leeches, Menaces, Grabbers, Spitballers, etc., but definitely ping them
- If possible activate your microphone, it's highly appreciated
