#### Tips

- The Scout has the most work as he has to care about finishing the primary and secondary objective. Support whereever you can and keep mining all minerals, even if your bags are full.
- Don't stop when you have finished the primary and secondary objective, but when you reached the last cave. There may be machine events, random spawns or just more gold.
- You can continue collecting morkite, even if the objective is met. It will give you more XP (especially interesting with active XP multiplier)
