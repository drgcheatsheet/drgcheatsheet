#### Tips

- Throw the Aquarqs instead of keep running with them, throwing and running after them is much faster
- If you are a good coordinated team, try to create a chain of dwarfs and throw the Aquarqs from one to the next dwarf
- There are no waves triggered when returning the Aquarqs. It makes no difference if your return one or all at a time.
