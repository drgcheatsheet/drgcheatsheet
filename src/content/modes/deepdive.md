#### Tips

- Deep Dive caves are pre-seeded, meaning you will play the exact same map, no matter how often you restart the game.
- You will only get the rewards once per week, but you can play the Deep Dive as long as you want
- Deep Dives are normally abbreviated as DD and Elite Deep Dives as EDD.
- Don't mine gold in Deep Dives, the mission itself already gives enough money and the Scout has much more important things to care about.
- Check out the [Deep Rock Galactic Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/) before starting a Deep Dive, if you don't want to be unprepared. There is always a pinned thread called "Weekly Deep Dives Thread - DAY MONTH 202X".
- Deep Dives difficulty is Hazard 3, Hazard 3.5, Hazard 3.5. Elite Deep Dive difficulty per level is Hazard 4.5, Hazard 5, Hazard 5.5.
- On Deep Dives, you should stop collecting Morkite when the objective is fulfilled.
- There are no machine events in Deep Dives so the only game mode where you don't need to explore the whole cave system.
