#### Tips

- When you take out the batteries of the caretaker, put them on top of the holes of it's mechanic arms. The batteries deal explosion damage and kill the arms instantly when they come out the first time.
- When you want to speedrun this mission type, you need to split up so that each team of dwarfs takes care of a Bet-C and then meet up at the caretaker.
- A often used strategy is to camp at one side of the caretaker, where you only have to deal wuith two arms. Then, always shoot the arms first, then the caretaker. This way you can create trenches, platforms and all kind of things to defend against turrets and keep your supplies around at that place.
