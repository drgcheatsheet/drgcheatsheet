#### Tips

- If speedrunning, trigger multiple eggs at once
- In most classes there are specific overclocks that are focused on high damage. This is the mode to take them out.

- Ice cannon is probably the best choice, if the other dwarfs have high damage classes that can hit hard on the dreadnoughts when they are frozen
- Learn the dreadnought patterns. Especiallt the twins (Glyphid Dreadnought Twins) have very specific attack patterns that you need to learn to dodge their attacks.
- When fighting the twins, damage them equally. This way they don't sync their health. They always sync once, but every other health sync phase means lost ammunition and time.
- Dreadnoughts can be instantly killed by a detonator. Get it near the egg and when it's about to explode, shoot the egg open. The Dreadnoughts will die instantly.

- Keep refilling your turret and help the driller to create a good battlefield, meaning close up holes, creating bridges or just multiple layer of platforms to jump around the dreadnoughts.

- You are the main damage dealer. Try to choose a build that deals heavy damage like the "Lead Storm" overclock on the Minigun.
- Setup some good zip lines for either avoidance of the dreadnoughts or as failsafe if someone gets hit and falls down to avoid fall damage.

- You can't really do much except choosing a high damage build, taking your medic role seriously and collecting a lot of nitra to keep your team healthy and in supply of ammo.
