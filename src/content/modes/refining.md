#### Tips

- When there are events in your cave, do them before triggering the refinery or when you are in a repair phase
- There is no time limit on repairing. If you discover events, minerals or other things later in the game, take your time and finish them before finishing the repair
- You can avoid fall damage when you fall directly on a pipe. The easiest way is to keep the activate button pressed (E on PC, X on Xbox)
