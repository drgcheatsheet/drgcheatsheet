#### Tips

- One person repairing the dozer already has 100% repair speed. There is no need to have one then one person repairing the dozer.
- Predrilling (drilling to the next cave before starting the dozer) is especially helpful when doing a deep dive, as the secondary objectives are often collectibles or even eggs, which are easier to do before starting the drill dozer.
- There is a short invincibility phase (1-2 seconds) when a part of the dozer is repaired to 100%. When there is a detonator about to explode, repair the dozer to 100% to avoid damage.
- Get Doretta's head after finishing the mission and take it back home. It won't give you any rewards, but you can keep your dwarf honor!
