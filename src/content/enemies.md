<h3 id="detonator">Detonator</h3>

- Don’t panic if a detonator spawns, they are quite slow
- You can kill dreadnought eggs with a detonator - Lure the detonator to the dreadnought egg and shortly before exploding, trigger the egg open
- If you spawn a [crassus detonator](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Glyphid_Crassus_Detonator?so=search) (golden), don’t explode it anywhere, lure it into a narrow tunnel, if no one is near, the driller can prepare one. This way you get the most gold out of it
- Lure the detonator away from the drilldozer (doretta) if you are on escort duty. A detonator killed at the wrong time can easily end the mission. Also see the tips on escort duty to protect doretta from detonator explosions

<h3 id="prospector">Prospector</h3>

- Don't trigger the prospector unannounced
- Scout is the main responsible class for the prospector. As soon as it’s triggered the Scout should only focus on the prospector, because he is the only class fast enough to chase after him and kill the whole health bar, before it heals up again.

<h3 id="korlok">Korlok Tyrant-Weed</h3>

- Always focus on healing pods first
