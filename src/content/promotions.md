<h2 id="promotions">Promotions</h2>

<Accordion>

- The game "really" starts after your first promotion
- The first promotion means, bringing any character to level 25, complete the then unlocked promotion assignment and promoting your character in the hall of fame
- After the first promotion you unlock Overclocks, Deep Dives, The Forge, The Market [and more](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Promotion)
- Don't do the missions of the promotion assignment with your level 25 dwarf - Dwarfs at level 25 don't collect any additional XP, which is why you should always do the promotion assignment with another class
- Try to promote every class at least once - As stated above, you need another class during the promotion assignment anyway and being able to quickly help out your team with a missing class and having everything unlocked also brings a lot of fun and variety to the game. It makes you a better player as well, as you can better relate to the challenges the other players have to face with their classes.
